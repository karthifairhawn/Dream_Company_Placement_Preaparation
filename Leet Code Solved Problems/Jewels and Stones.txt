771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
         Map<Character,Integer> hp=new HashMap<>();
        
        for(int i=0;i<stones.length();i++){
            char a=stones.charAt(i);
           if(hp.containsKey(a)){
               int c=hp.get(a);
               c++;
               hp.put(a,c);
           }
            else{
                hp.put(a,1);
            }
        }
        int c=0;
        for(int j=0;j<jewels.length();j++){
            if(hp.containsKey(jewels.charAt(j))){
                c+=hp.get(jewels.charAt(j));
            }
               
        }
       // System.out.print(hp);
        return c;
